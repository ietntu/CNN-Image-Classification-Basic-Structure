# CNN-Image-Classification-Basic-Structure
This repo serves as an archive of the project structure focusing on the Shopee Data Science Challenge 2017.

The challenge was done in late 2017. Our team actually did not rank at a satisfying level. However, I still regard this challenge as my stepping stone to the Machine Learning and Deep Learning. The slides are made by me and used on the tutorial where we shared the experiences with juniors in October 2018.
